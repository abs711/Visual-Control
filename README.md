NOTE: The dataset used in the paper would soon be hosted on a publicly available repository. 

torchVision/MainPain/main.py is the main script to run. The models used in the paper are defined the UtilX/Vision4Prosthetics.py. A supporting document explaining the information flow between different scripts would be added soon!
